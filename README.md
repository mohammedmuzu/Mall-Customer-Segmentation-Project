# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Project

In the **Mall Customer Segmentation** project, the goal is to divide customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors to understand their shopping habits. This helps businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and boost sales.

### Key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset typically includes customer details such as age, gender, income, spending score, and sometimes more specific data like shopping frequency.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves cleaning the data (handling missing values, removing outliers) and preparing it for analysis, which may include scaling or normalizing variables to ensure accurate segmentation.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization techniques are used to understand the distribution of variables like income, spending score, and age. Heatmaps, histograms, and scatterplots help identify patterns and relationships.

4. **Choosing a Segmentation Method**:
   - **K-Means Clustering** is a common method, grouping customers based on similarities in their spending behavior and other features.
   - **Hierarchical Clustering** is another approach for more complex segmentation.
   - The optimal number of clusters is determined using techniques like the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score**.

5. **Cluster Profiling**: After creating clusters, each group is analyzed to understand their characteristics. For example:
   - High-income, high-spending customers could be classified as VIPs.
   - Low-income, low-spending customers might fall under a different segment.

6. **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on the segmentation, strategies can be recommended, such as personalized marketing, targeted promotions for high-value customers, or efforts to engage low-spending customers.

This project can provide valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling the mall to make data-driven decisions for improved customer targeting and retention.
